## Ketsia Pierelus
I am a student at UMBC, majoring in Translational Life Science Technology (TLST) with a focus on the bioinformatics track. I am drawn to this track because of my interest in the intersection of computer science and biology. My academic goal is to gain a deep understanding of the core concepts in bioinformatics and machine learning, with the aim of graduating in May 2025.

## Aimee Icaza
I am a TLST Bioinformatics major at UMBC. My academic goal is to complete my bachelor's degree and pursue a Ph.D. program in Computational Biology. I have a strong interest in genomics and oncology research, and I am eager to deepen my knowledge of machine learning with coding laguages such as R. python, and use of linux. To advance my career in the industry

## Li Lan Fang 
Driven by a strong academic foundation in Translational Life Science and Technology (TLST) with a Bioinformatics track (B.S.), I am pursuing a Master of Science degree in either Data Science or Business Administration (MBA).  My professional objective is to expand my knowledge of machine learning beyond the laboratory setting and contribute to an intellectually stimulating environment where I can continuously learn and engage in challenging work.  Currently, I am focused on enhancing my programming proficiency, particularly in Python.
Academic goal, research ideas, career goals, future onlook.
